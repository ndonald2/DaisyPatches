# DaisyPatches

My patches for Daisy platform

This is a "soft fork" of [DaisyExamples](https://github.com/electro-smith/DaisyExamples) with
simplifications and modifications to suit my own workflow needs. As such it carries the original MIT
license from DaisyExamples. See that repo's README for additional information.
